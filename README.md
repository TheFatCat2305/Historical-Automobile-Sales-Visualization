# Historical-Automobile-Sales-Visualization


This project demonstrates data visualization techniques using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium) to analyze historical automobile sales data, particularly focusing on trends during recession periods.

## Project Overview

The notebook creates various visualizations to explore automobile sales data from 1980 to 2023. It includes:
- Line charts showing sales trends over years
- Analysis of sales during recession periods
- Data from multiple economic indicators (GDP, unemployment rate, consumer confidence)

## Dataset

The dataset (`historical_automobile_sales.csv`) contains:
- Date (1980-2023)
- Recession indicator
- Automobile sales figures
- Economic variables (GDP, Unemployment Rate, etc.)
- Vehicle types and other relevant metrics


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook environment

## Required Libraries
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
folium
